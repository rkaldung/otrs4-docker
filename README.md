#OTRS 4 on Docker
============

A DOCKERFILE to setup an OTRS 4 Instance using CentOS 6 as base Image.

This OTRS Version is the regular, (non) ITSM Version. See "Run Container" section for more details and the ITSM Version.

##Access

This System uses two exposed ports 80 (HTTPD) / 22 (SSHD). SSH is necessary to change some the config files (Config.pm), add LDAP stuff and so on. If you use the defaults you can disable port 22.

The root user is "root", so is the password.
**Please change this values in production!**

You can access the OTRS using the link: 

 - http://DOCKERHOST:PORT/otrs/index.pl (Agent Interface)
 - http://DOCKERHOST:PORT/otrs/customer.pl (Customer Interface)

The OTRS root user is "root@localhost", the password is root.
**Please change this values in production!**

Replace DOCKERHOST with the IP / Hostname of your Docker Server.

The cronjobs are enabled, you can change them via SSH.

##Note

This instance uses mod_perl. We needed to modify the Apache config (/etc/httpd/conf.d/zzz_otrs.conf). The default configuration checks for mod_perl.c, which does not comply to CentOS which needs mod_perl.so.

Look at L:18 of the DOCKERFILE for more details.

The MySQL root user has no password set. You need to set it yourself (if needed), or use an external database connection. You can change the connection settings in /opt/otrs/Kernel/Config.pm.

##System Design

This DOCKERFILE add's: 
 - MySQL
 - Apache
 - Perl
 - All needed dependencies
 - OTRS 4.0.8 (RPM)

##Run Container

### Non-ITSM
     docker pull hanneshal/otrs4-docker
     docker run -d -p 80 -p 22 --name otrs408 hanneshal/otrs4-docker
     docker ps (to get the ports)
     
### ITSM 
     docker pull hanneshal/otrs4-docker:latest-itsm
     docker run -d -p 80 -p 22 --name otrsitsm408 hanneshal/otrs4-docker:latest-itsm
     docker ps (to get the ports)

 **Note: On first run the ITSM is being installed. This could take up to 2 minutes. 
 After the installation the SSH and Webserver daemons are started. Please be patient.**

Have fun.
